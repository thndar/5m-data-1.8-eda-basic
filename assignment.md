# Assignment

## Brief

Write the Python codes for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as Python in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Question: How do you select rows from a DataFrame where any value in the row exceeds a threshold?

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'B': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]})
threshold = 30
```

Answer:

```
selected_rows = df[df.max(axis=1) > threshold]

```

### Question 2

Question: How do you sort a DataFrame by columns `A` and `B`?

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [2, 1, 2], 'B': [2, 3, 1], 'C': [1, 2, 3]})
```

Answer:

```
sorted_df = df.sort_values(['A', 'B'], ascending=[True, False])

```

### Question 3

Question: How do you concatenate two DataFrames vertically?

```python
import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [7, 8, 9], 'B': [10, 11, 12]})
```

Answer:

```
combined_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)

```

### Question 4

Question: How do you compute the cumulative sum of a column in a DataFrame?

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
```

Answer:

```
df['cumsum'] = df['A'].cumsum()

```

### Question 5

Question: How do you convert a Series of strings to uppercase?

```python
import pandas as pd

series = pd.Series(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])
```

Answer:

```
